Code Breakdown and Explanation:
AsyncOptions Class:

The AsyncOptions class is used in Salesforce to define options for asynchronous execution, such as specifying a duplicate signature for Queueable jobs.
DuplicateSignature Property:

The DuplicateSignature is a unique identifier for a Queueable job. Salesforce uses this to determine if a job with the same signature is already enqueued or running. If a job with the same DuplicateSignature is found, it won't enqueue the duplicate unless the signature changes.
QueueableDuplicateSignature.Builder():

This builder is used to construct a DuplicateSignature with various components like user IDs, strings, integers, etc., allowing flexibility in how the signature is defined.
UserInfo.getUserId():

This retrieves the ID of the current user, ensuring the signature is user-specific.
System.enqueueJob():

Enqueues a Queueable job (LeadQueueable in this case) for asynchronous execution.
